             I play them almost everywhere nowadays since I can download games on my phone. I play story based games, multiplayer games, single player games, building games, and the occasional rpg. I spend a good amount of my day on games but I won't play most games if my friends aren't playing such as fortnite or Pub G. <center/></font><p/>
